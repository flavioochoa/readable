# Readable Project

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The server supports a small, fixed number of categories that users can put posts into. Categories are simple objects containing a name and a URL path (usually the same string). The server does not have methods for creating/modifying/deleting these categories.
